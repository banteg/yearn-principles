              You can't build trustless systems without trust.
            </h2>
            <p>
              Yearn runs on trust. Trust fosters strong connections and helps
              things run smoothly, allowing Yearn to circumvent the burdens of
              traditional corporate middle management. We move at the speed of
              trust because we believe it's the most efficient way to get things
              done - all our other principles are possible because we choose to
              trust each other.

              Belief is great, but building is better. As a contributor, you are
              the person who knows what's best to do for Yearn. We don't wait
              for approvals or authorization, permission is self granted, and
              action is revered. At Yearn self starters have nothing between
              them and the glorious horizon. The future belongs to those who do.

              Friction is inevitable, but conflict doesn't have to be. We
              operate under the assumption that our fellow contributors are
              fundamentally good, reasonable, and trustworthy. Stir some hard
              work, talent and capability into the mix and it's easy to see why
              even when things go wrong, we always take the Most Respectful
              Interpretation of each others actions.

            <p>
              Creativity is our competitive edge. When boldness is met with
              trust and empathy, magic occurs. We understand that the craziest
              ideas can spawn entirely new industries - Yearn is living proof of
              it. No thought is too crazy, no plan too weird, no ambition too
              out there. Yearn exists in a realm beyond nation state borders,
              but we're proud to let our freak flag fly.

              Yearn is a place that values ideas over identity. Whether you're a
              defi og or a newb on the Discord, the best contributions will
              always be respected. We're all for personality, but never cult of
              personality. Here, work always trumps credentials - we don't care
              who you are, only what you do.

            <p>
              Decentralization isn't just best for the protocol, it's also best
              for the people building it. The future doesn't look like a
              corporate strategy deck or some complex org chart. It looks like
              nature - messy, chaotic and full of surprises. Yearn find order
              from chaos, scaling in harmony with other orgs and the wider
              space.

              The protocol isn't our only product. Yearn is a community of
              independent builders who are free to sprout new organizations and
              grow the network organically. Each day Yearn supports the
              flourishing Defi ecosystem by uniting exceptional people around
              radical projects that make finance more flexible and accessible.
              This synergistic relationship guides Yearn to build its code and
              community with integrity.
